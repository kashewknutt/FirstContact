Understanding Communities: LGBTQIA+

Who?
Have you ever been the introvert of the group? Or found yourself trying your best but still longing to be heard. Have you caught a moment where everyone is judging and your friends themselves appear distant?

A community by definition is a group of people living in the same locality and sharing interests. The funny thing is when people join them, their primary motive is exploring.

The same explorer closes his doors when it comes to this area. Why is this?
They are just like us. They also have jobs, families, kids, etc.

Why is sexuality considered such a big deal?

Why?

One of the biggest problems a person deals with is loneliness. You might have been stuck on a maths question in school some time, where your teacher or friend would have guided you through it. 

The idea is, talking to someone helped you get through a difficult situation.
But since this community has been declared a big ‘NO-NO’ in a lot of families, people are too scared to talk about it and often find themselves unguided and confused.

Thus, the need for such communities and platforms like firstcontact.lgbt becomes very important. 


What?

What do they want? This is one of the most asked questions in Indian families.
